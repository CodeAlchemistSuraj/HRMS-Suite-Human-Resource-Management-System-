## üîí Security Implementation Details  

Security is a cornerstone of **HRMS-Suite**, utilizing a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** model enforced by Spring Security:  

- **Authentication**: Users authenticate via credentials to receive a secure **JSON Web Token (JWT)**.  
- **Authorization**: JWT validates user identity and roles in subsequent requests, determining permissions.  
- **Granular Control**: Access to API endpoints and data is restricted based on roles (*HR Admin, Manager, Employee*), adhering to the **Least Privilege Access** principle.

## üèÅ Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- **Java 17+** (for Spring Boot)  
- **Node.js 16+** (for React.js frontend)  
- **Docker** (for containerization)  
- **Maven** (for dependency management)  

### Installation  

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/hrms-suite.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd hrms-suite

# Build and run the microservices using Docker
docker-compose up --build

# Install frontend dependencies and start the React app
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
````

### Configuration

* Update **application.yml** in each microservice for database and JWT configurations.
* Set up **environment variables** for sensitive data (e.g., database credentials, JWT secret).

---

## üìñ Usage

* Access the application via **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** (default frontend port).
* Log in with appropriate credentials based on user role (*HR Admin, Manager, Employee*).
* Navigate through modules (*Employee, Payroll, Attendance, Performance*) to manage HR tasks.
